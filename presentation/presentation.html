### Introduction

Reported first in December, 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic constitutes the largest global public health crisis in a century, with daunting health and socioeconomic challenges. In the United States alone, more than 700,000 people have lost their lives due to the public health crisis. The progress in vaccination rates, as well as the spread of Delta variant, added more nuances to the overall situation.

### Overall Goal

In this project, we focus on the COVID-19 data in the U.S. We aim to explore:

- The fluctuations of deaths and cases across time since January, 2020

- Trying to predict the number of daily new deaths from daily new cases
    
- The potential correlation/relationship between seasons and deaths and cases

- The potential correlation/relationship between vaccination rates and deaths and cases across time

### COVID-19 Cases and Deaths - The Beginning
On January 22nd, 2020, the CDC began tracking daily COVID19 cases and deaths
across the United States and its territories. Eventually, on March 11th, 2020,
WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. This day also coincided with the NBA
shutting down indefinitely. Two days later, Bates College announced they would 
be sending us home!

How do these two key dates compare the worst day(s) of the pandemic?

&lt;h3&gt;COVID-19 Cases and Deaths - How did they evolve with time?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this pandemic, we have experienced periods of low cases and deaths and periods of high cases and deaths. These ebbs and flows are typically called "waves". Our first goal was to visualize the "waves" of the pandemic - when were things the worst and when did things seem to be better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

### COVID-19 Cases and Deaths - What is the correlation?
Before we use the R `ccf()` function, let's take a look at the relationship between
cases and deaths with no lag:

### COVID-19 Cases and Deaths - What is the correlation?
Let's take a look at the residuals plot to assess whether a linear model is appropriate:

### COVID-19 Cases and Deaths - What is the correlation?
Results from the linear regression:

```

## Fit time:  2ms

```

```

##       &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;

## # … with 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt;
```

The linear model is given by `y = 0.01146x + 274.67437`. This tells us that for 
each additional daily case, we expect the number of daily deaths to increase on 
average by `0.01146`. Additionally, we can see `\(R^2 = 0.673\)`, which indicates 
that about 67.3% of the variation in the daily new deaths is dependent on 
daily new cases.

### COVID-19 Cases and Deaths - What is the correlation?
Typically, when we are comparing two variables `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`, we calculate the 
correlation coefficient 
`$$\rho = \frac{\sigma_{XY}}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$$` 
The correlation coefficient describes how one variable moves in relation to 
another. When dealing with time series data and both `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` 
are functions of time, the time series `\(Y_t\)` might be related to past lags of 
the time series `\(X_t\)`. In other words, if our time series is discrete 
(it must be), we want to determine the relationship between `\(X_{t + h}\)` and
`\(Y_t\)` for `\(h = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, ...\)`. The **cross correlation coefficient** is 
thus given by
`$$\rho = \frac{\sigma_{X_{t + h}Y_t}}{\sigma_{X_{t + h}}\sigma_{Y_t}}$$` 
Two things to note :

- When one or more `\(X_{t + h}\)`, with `\(h\)` *negative*, are predictors of `\(Y_t\)`, 
it is sometimes said that **x leads y**

- When one or more `\(X_{t + h}\)`, with `\(h\)` *positive*, are predictors of `\(Y_t\)`, 
it is sometimes said that **x lags y** `\(^*\)`

### COVID-19 Vaccinations Over Time
Now let's take a look at how the number people of vaccinated in the United States 
has evolved with time:

### COVID-19 Vaccinations Over Time
Although the total population of the US is only about ~55% vaccinated as of early 
October, 2021, this does not paint a full picture. Let's break down this percentage
by age group:

### Exploring the Seasonality of COVID-19
Let's explore the relationship between COVID-19 and the four seasons:

### Exploring the Seasonality of COVID-19
Towards the end of this semester, we learned how to create models with 
categorical explanatory variables. Let's run a linear regression by factoring
the `season` variable:

```
## parsnip model object
## 
## Fit time:  3ms 
## 
## Call:
## stats::lm(formula = total_new_cases ~ factor(season), data = data)
## 
## Coefficients:
##          (Intercept)  factor(season)Spring  factor(season)Summer  
##                94742                -62732                -38921  
## factor(season)Winter  
##                16734
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 12
##   r.squared adj.r.squared  sigma statistic  p.value    df logLik    AIC    BIC
##       &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     0.246         0.242 54482.      67.3 1.09e-37     3 -7676. 15362. 15385.
## # … with 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt;
```
This tells us that the average number of daily new cases in the Fall is 94,747.
It is also possible to derive the daily new cases averages for the other seasons 
from this as well. Additionally, note that `\(R^2 \approx 0.25\)`. This tells us that 
about 25% of the of the variation in the daily new cases 
is dependent on the season.
---
### Tying Seasonality into the Relationship Between Cases and Deaths
Finally, let's try to see if the relationship between deaths and cases does or
does not vary by the season. This type of analysis is equivalent to interpreting
main vs. interaction effects. We will start with the main effects:



![](presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
---
### Tying Seasonality into the Relationship Between Cases and Deaths
Now we will view the interaction effects:

![](presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
---
### Tying Seasonality into the Relationship Between Cases and Deaths

```r
deaths_cases_main_fit
```

```
## parsnip model object
## 
## Fit time:  1ms 
## 
## Call:
## stats::lm(formula = total_new_deaths ~ total_new_cases + factor(season), 
##     data = data)
## 
## Coefficients:
##          (Intercept)       total_new_cases  factor(season)Spring  
##             63.35585               0.01121             358.18337  
## factor(season)Summer  factor(season)Winter  
##             30.56139             548.22508
```
Therefore:
`$$\hat{deaths} = 63 + 0.011 * cases + 358 * spring + 31 * summer + 548 * winter$$`
---
### Tying Seasonality into the Relationship Between Cases and Deaths

```r
deaths_cases_int_fit
```

```
## parsnip model object
## 
## Fit time:  2ms 
## 
## Call:
## stats::lm(formula = total_new_deaths ~ total_new_cases * factor(season), 
##     data = data)
## 
## Coefficients:
##                          (Intercept)                       total_new_cases  
##                           301.559333                              0.008691  
##                 factor(season)Spring                  factor(season)Summer  
##                           319.137034                             85.625649  
##                 factor(season)Winter  total_new_cases:factor(season)Spring  
##                             1.975292                             -0.003707  
## total_new_cases:factor(season)Summer  total_new_cases:factor(season)Winter  
##                            -0.002740                              0.005278
```
Therefore:
`$$\hat{d} = 302 + 0.0087 * c + 319 * sp  + 87 * su + 2 * w - 0.0037 * sp * c - 0.0027 * su * c + 0.0053 * w * c$$`
---
### Tying Seasonality into the Relationship Between Cases and Deaths
Let's compare the adjusted `\(R^2\)` values:

```r
glance(deaths_cases_main_fit)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 12
##   r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic   p.value    df logLik   AIC   BIC
##       &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     0.736         0.735  450.      431. 3.37e-177     4 -4688. 9388. 9414.
## # … with 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt;
```

```r
glance(deaths_cases_int_fit)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 12
##   r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic   p.value    df logLik   AIC   BIC
##       &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     0.784         0.781  409.      319. 7.78e-200     7 -4626. 9270. 9310.
## # … with 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt;
```
It appears that adding the `season` variable increased adjusted `\(R^2\)`, so it makes
sense to include it in our model.
---
### Conclusions and Takeaways
- There is a positive linear relationship between cases and deaths
- Deaths are most correlated to cases with a 7 day lag
- Vaccination percentages vary widely by age group
- There is an approximately 65 day lag until daily new deaths and percent
of population fully vaccinated becomes negatively correlated. 
- There is a relationship between the season and COVID-19 cases/deaths numbers
- Knowing the season improves our ability to model deaths versus cases
