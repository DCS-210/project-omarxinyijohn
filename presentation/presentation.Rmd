### Introduction

Reported first in December, 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic constitutes the largest global public health crisis in a century, with daunting health and socioeconomic challenges. In the United States alone, more than 700,000 people have lost their lives due to the public health crisis. The progress in vaccination rates, as well as the spread of Delta variant, added more nuances to the overall situation.

### Overall Goal

In this project, we focus on the COVID-19 data in the U.S. We aim to explore:

- The fluctuations of deaths and cases across time since December, 2019
    
- The potential correlation between seasons and deaths and cases

- The potential correlation between vaccination rates and deaths and cases across time
    
- The differences in cases, deaths, and vaccinations across states

- The popularity of the main kinds of vaccines (J&J, Pfizer, Moderna) in different states

### COVID-19 Cases and Deaths - The Beginning
On January 22nd, 2020, the CDC began tracking daily COVID19 cases and deaths
across the United States and its territories. Eventually, on March 11th, 2020,
WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. This day also coincided with the NBA
shutting down indefinitely. Two days later, Bates College announced they would 
be sending us home!

How do these two key dates compare the worst day(s) of the pandemic?

<h3>COVID-19 Cases and Deaths - How did they evolve with time?</h3>
<p>Throughout this pandemic, we have experienced periods of low cases and deaths and periods of high cases and deaths. These ebbs and flows are typically called "waves". Our first goal was to visualize the "waves" of the pandemic - when were things the worst and when did things seem to be better?</p>

### COVID-19 Cases and Deaths - What is the correlation?
Typically, when we are comparing two variables $X$ and $Y$, we calculate the 
correlation coefficient 
$$\rho = \frac{\sigma_{XY}}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$$ 
The correlation coefficient describes how one variable moves in relation to 
another. When dealing with time series data and both $X$ and $Y$ 
are functions of time, the time series $Y_t$ might be related to past lags of 
the time series $X_t$. In other words, if our time series is discrete 
(it must be), we want to determine the relationship between $X_{t + h}$ and
$Y_t$ for $h = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, ...$. The **cross correlation coefficient** is 
thus given by
$$\rho = \frac{\sigma_{X_{t + h}Y_t}}{\sigma_{X_{t + h}}\sigma_{Y_t}}$$ 
Two things to note :

- When one or more $X_{t + h}$, with $h$ *negative*, are predictors of $Y_t$, 
it is sometimes said that **x leads y**

- When one or more $X_{t + h}$, with $h$ *positive*, are predictors of $Y_t$, 
it is sometimes said that **x lags y** $^*$

### COVID-19 Cases and Deaths - What is the correlation?
Results from the linear regression:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
deaths_cases_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(total_new_deaths ~ total_new_cases, data = new_US_deaths_cases) 

deaths_cases_fit

glance(deaths_cases_fit)
```

The linear model is given by `y = 0.01146x + 274.67437`. This tells us that for 
each additionally daily case, we expect the number of daily deaths to increase on 
average by `0.01146`. Additionally, we can see $R^2 = 0.673$, which indicates 
that only about 67.3% of the variation in the daily new deaths is dependent on 
daily new cases.

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.
